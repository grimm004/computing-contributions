1. Interest of content:
   --Good-- Some interesting information about applications that are indeed useful for the society.

2. Consistency and quality of visual presentation:
   --Good-- the home page looks really nice, I like the way it links all the pages together. The design is quite minimalistic but in a             way that keeps all of the pages easy to use. However, the aspect of the other pages (except for the home) could have been        improved (use more images maybe?).

3. Quality of written presentation:
   --Very good-- No spelling errors, text seems well written overall.

4. Validity of HTML:
   Excellent: the HTML has no mistakes and is easy to read through, due to indentation. It also is very well structured. 

5. Evidence of collaboration including:
 - Author info not written by author:
   --Very good-- info was written by other team members, the authors just updated their own pictures.
 
 - Balanced contributions from members:
   --Good-- all of the members made commits, but it seems like some of them contributed a little more to the project than others.
  
 - Not completed at the last minute:
   --Good-- last updates were made 8 hours before the practical.
