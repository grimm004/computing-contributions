Interest of content
Good
The pages have somewhat lengthy texts on them but most are broken up by subheadings and images and are fairly well written

Consistency and quality of visual presentation
exemplary
really nice looking presentation with a professional looking nav bar and template

Quality of written presentation
Sound
the AI and internet of things pages are nicely presented with images and subheadings, while the communication and education pages are a little bit plain, however the author information sections on each page are well presented.

Validity of HTML
excellent
nice indentation and clear structure, no comments but its fine

Evidence of collaboration including:
very good

	Author info not written by author
seems to have been written about each other

	Balanced contributions from members
three of four team members contributed to the homepage, quality does vary between individual pages

	Not completed at the last minute
completed in 6 days from start to finish which seems reasonable for a project this size
